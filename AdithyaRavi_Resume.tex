			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Rating predictions from reviews given to products in online markets:\newline(Technologies Used: Python, Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, SciKit, Seaborn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, NLTK, TQDM, OpenAI API)}\newline Created four models to categorise reviews on popular e-commerce websites according to whether they are seller-related, marketplace-related, shipment-related, or product-related and then predict their rating. A CNN, RNN/LSTM, BERT, and SVM with and without splitting were among the models. With a 40.99\% overall accuracy and accuracy rates of 34.12\% for product-related reviews, 41.77\% for delivery-related reviews, 44.70\% for seller-related reviews, and 43.36\% for marketplace-related reviews, the SVM model without splitting had the highest accuracy. 
				\item  \textbf{Trail of Terror:\newline(Technologies Used: Python, Libraries: turtle)}\newline
                Used Python to create a fun, interactive game with a simple GUI, enhancing game functionality with both the Singleton and Factory Creational design patterns. Implementing unique game features and ideas increased user engagement by 40\%, resulting in an average playtime of 30 minutes each session.
				\item  \textbf{Heart attack prediction using Multi-Layer Perceptron model:\newline(Technologies Used: Python, Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, SciKit, Seaborn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow)}\newline Developed a robust multi layer perceptron model with 6 hidden layers to train the model utilizing a dataset downloaded from Kaggle, resulting in a 88\% accurate prediction on the test dataset. Implemented data preprocessing techniques such as normalization and feature scaling to improve training accuracy by 15\% and reduce overfitting of the model.
				\item  \textbf{Online Aid For Detecting Brain Tumor And Tuberculosis Using Deep Learning:\newline(B.E. Capstone Project, Technologies Used: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)}\newline Developed and implemented an innovative front-end layout for a web application that allowed doctors/users to upload X-ray and MRI data. Convolutional neural networks ResNet and MobileNetV2 were implemented with up to 99\% accuracy to detect brain tumours and tuberculosis from user's X-ray/MRI data, decreasing the requirement for intrusive testing procedures by over 50\%. The ResNet and MobileNetV2 models' metrics for performance, like precision, recall, and F1 score, improved by 5\% as a result of the team's collaboration to optimise the techniques utilised in the models.
